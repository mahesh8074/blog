<h2>Player acquisition, Squad composition, and Salaries:</h3><hr/></h2> 
<p>
    A team can acquire players through the annual player auction, trading with other teams during trading windows, and signing replacements for unavailable players. Players sign up for the auction[52] and set their base price and are bought by the highest-bidding franchise. Unsold players at the auction can become replacement signings. Trades require player consent, and any contract differences are covered by the franchise. There are typically three trading windows: two before the auction and one before the tournament. No trading is allowed outside these windows or during the tournament, but replacements can be signed before or during the event.<br/><br/></p><img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQJ30Cd4gfZ9l0IGw_wfDZkR080SWhjjRogag&s" width="35%" height="300rem" align="right"/>

<h3>Prize Money:</h3>
<p>The 2022 season of the IPL offered total prize money of ₹46.5 crore (equivalent to ₹49 crore or US$5.9 million in 2023), with the winning team netting ₹20 crore (equivalent to ₹21 crore or US$2.5 million in 2023) and the second-placed team ₹13 crore (equivalent to ₹14 crore or US$1.7 million in 2023).League rules mandate that half of any prize money must be distributed amongst the franchise's players.</p> 
<h2>Unique rules and variations<hr/></h2>
<p>The IPL has several rules which vary from the established Laws of cricket or those used in other Twenty20 (T20) leagues:</p>
<ul>
    <li>IPL games incorporate television timeouts. Each team is given a two-and-a-half-minute "strategic time-out" during each innings. One must be taken by the bowling team at the end of either 6th, 7th, 8th or 9th over and the other by the batting team at the end of either 13th, 14th, 15th or 16th over. A penalty may be imposed if umpires find teams misusing this privilege.</li>
    <li>Since the 2018 season, the Decision Review System (DRS) has been used in all IPL matches, allowing each team two opportunities in each innings to review an on-field umpire's decision. From the 2023 season, this was extended to allow the review of wides and no-balls.</li>
    <li>If the bowling team does not complete its overs in the allocated time, it may place only four fielders outside of the fielding restrictions circle for the remainder of the innings,or the match referee may impose financial sanctions on the bowling team after the match, with players fined a proportion of their match fee.</li>
    <li>Teams can use a substitute, termed an "impact player", from a list of five players named as possible substitutes. The substitution can be made before the start of the innings, when a wicket falls, when a batter retires or at the end of an over. Both teams can introduce a substitute once per match.</li>
    <li>Teams can declare their playing eleven to the match referee before or after the toss.</li>
    <li>A five-run penalty is imposed if a fielder or wicket-keeper makes an unfair movement while the bowler is bowling and the ball is designated as dead ball.</li>
    <li>Teams can include a maximum of four overseas players in their playing eleven. If a team wants an overseas player as impact player, then it must include a maximum of three overseas players in their playing eleven.</li>
    <li>Teams must include 25 players, with a maximum of eight overseas players.</li>
    <li>From the 2024 season, bowlers will be allowed to deliver two bouncers an over. This change in playing conditions was trialled during the 2023–24 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, India's domestic T20 tournament.</li>

<h2>Finances<hr/></h2>
<h3>Title sponsorship:</h3>
<p>From 2008 to 2012, the IPL title sponsor was DLF, India's largest real estate developer, which bid ₹200 crore (US$24 million) for the rights for five seasons. After the 2012 season, PepsiCo bought the title sponsorship rights for ₹397 crore (US$48 million) for the next five seasonsbut terminated the deal in October 2015, two years before the expiry of the contract, due to the two-season suspension of the Chennai and Rajasthan franchises from the league. The BCCI transferred the title sponsorship rights for the remaining two seasons of the contract to Chinese smartphone manufacturer Vivo for ₹200 crore (US$24 million).</p>
<p>
    In June 2017, Vivo retained the rights for the next five seasons from 2018 to 2022 with a winning bid of ₹2,199 crore (US$260 million). On 4 August 2020, Vivo canceled the title sponsorship rights due to the military stand-off between India and China at the Line of Actual Control in July 2020. The withdrawal was also a result of Vivo's market losses due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; Vivo intended to return as the title sponsor for the following three years. Dream11 became the title sponsors for the 2020 IPL for an amount of ₹222 crore (equivalent to ₹261 crore or US$31 million in 2023). Vivo returned as the title sponsor for the 2021 IPL season but withdrew again, and was replaced by the Tata Group for the next two seasons. InsideSport reported the BCCI would receive ₹498 crore (US$60 million) for the 2022 and 2023 seasons from title sponsors. Vivo had previously agreed to pay a higher amount for the last two seasons of its sponsorship contract due to the league's expansion from the 2022 season. According to InsideSport, due to the new deal's structure, Tata would pay ₹335 crore (US$40 million) per year while Vivo would pay the deficit of ₹163 crore (US$20 million) per season.

<h3>Payments to foreign national boards:</h3>
<p>The BCCI pays ten per cent of the auctioned value of players to their national cricket boards. In January 2018, IPL chairman Rajiv Shukla said the IPL would double the amount paid to cricket boards that made their players available for an entire season.[105] In 2022, Australian Cricketers' Association expressed its unhappiness about this.</p><br/>
<h2>Broadcasting<hr/></h2>
<p><b>2023–2027: Star Sports and JioCinema</b></p>
<p>The next cycle of IPL media rights will last from 2023 to 2027 and will be put to auction. In this auction, the broadcasting rights were divided into four packages. Package A was for domestic television rights, and Package B was for domestic digital rights. Package C was for the digital rights of eighteen non-exclusive matches, and Package D was for international television and digital rights, further divided into four groups. On 13 June 2022, it was reported the packages for domestic television and streaming rights had fetched at least ₹397.75 billion (nearly US$5.1 billion) in total, doubling the value of the 2018–2022 contract.</p>
<p>In February 2023, Viacom18 announced it would stream the 2023 IPL for free on JioCinema with feeds in 12 languages, including English and regional languages, and in 4K resolution. The same month, The Walt Disney Company reported its loss of the IPL had contributed to a net loss of 2.4 million Disney+ subscribers worldwide, primarily in India.</p>
